# hell

My first version of this experiment wasn't good; I never used it.

I've been working on a more practical version based somewhat on my
work with [the jl](https://github.com/chrisdone/jl) tool which is
simply typed lambda calculus for querying JSON data structures. I
believe the same mini-language can work well for a shell.

Watch this space for updates.
